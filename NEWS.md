  The function `check_miniconda_args` was clearly defined in its own file. 
  The only way to fix it was copying the function into the same one where it
  was called `fill_yaml`.
  - Thought it might be a permissions issues with *check_miniconda_args.R* but 
  the permissions are identical with all the others.
