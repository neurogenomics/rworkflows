## Intro

[*GitHub Actions*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are a powerful
way to automatically launch workflows every time you push changes to a
GitHub repository. This is a form of [*Continuous Integration
(CI)*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration),
which helps ensure that your code is always working as expected (without
having to manually check each time).

Here, we have designed a robust, reusable, and flexible *action*
specifically for the development of R packages. We also provide an R
function to automatically generate a *workflow file* that calls the
`rworkflows` composite action:

Currently, `rworkflows` *action* performs the following tasks:

1.  Builds a Docker container to run subsequent steps within.
2.  Builds and checks your R package (with CRAN and/or Bioconductor
    checks).  
3.  Runs units tests.  
4.  Runs code coverage tests and uploads the results to
    [*Codecov*](https://about.codecov.io/).  
5.  (Re)builds and launches a documentation website for your R
    package.  
6.  Pushes an [*Rstudio*](https://www.rstudio.com/)
    [*Docker*](https://www.docker.com/) container to
    [*DockerHub*](https://hub.docker.com/) with your R package and all
    its dependencies pre-installed.

Importantly, these *workflow files* and *action* are designed to work
with any R package out-of-the-box. This means you won’t have to manually
edit any yaml files, just run the `rworkflows::use_workflow()` function
and you’re ready to go!

## [Documentation](https://neurogenomics.github.io/rworkflows)

### [Get started](https://neurogenomics.github.io/rworkflows/articles/rworkflows.html)

### [Docker/Singularity](https://neurogenomics.github.io/rworkflows/articles/docker)

## Quickstart

Install and create the workflow in your R package’s project folder.

``` r
## in R
if(!require("rworkflows")) remotes::install_github("neurogenomics/rworkflows")
path <- rworkflows::use_workflow()
```

Push to GitHub, and let everything else run automatically!

``` bash
## in the Terminal
git add .
git commit -m "Added GHA workflow via rworkflows::use_workflow()"
git push
```

## Acknowledgments

`rworkflows` builds upon the work of many others, especially the
following:

<details>

### [`biocthis`](https://github.com/lcolladotor/biocthis)

This workflow is derived from the workflow generated by the
[`use_bioc_github_action()`](https://lcolladotor.github.io/biocthis/articles/biocthis.html)
function within the
[`biothis`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biocthis.html)
package.

#### Key changes in `rworkflows`

-   Uses dynamic variables to specify R/Bioconductor versions
    (e.g. `r: "latest"`) and the name of your R package, as opposed to
    static names that are likely to become outdated
    (e.g. `r: "4.0.1"`).  
-   Additional error handling and dependencies checks.  
-   Re-renders `README.Rmd` before rebuilding the documentation website.

### [`github-pages-deploy-action`](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action)

Builds and deploys the GitHub Pages documentation website in the
`rworkflows` GHA workflows.

### [`bioconductor_docker`](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker)

Uses the official
[`bioconductor/bioconductor_docker`](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker)
Docker container.

**NOTE**: The `bioconductor/bioconductor_docker` container often lags
behind the actual Bioconductor releases. This means that sometimes
“devel” in `Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker` is actually referring to
the “release” version of Bioconductor. See this
[Issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker/issues/37)
for details.

### [`scFlow`](https://github.com/combiz/scFlow)

This DockerFile was partly adapted from the [scFlow
Dockerfile](https://github.com/combiz/scFlow/blob/master/Dockerfile).

Unlike other Dockerfiles, this one **does not require any manual editing
when applying to different R packages**. This means that users who are
unfamiliar with Docker do not have to troubleshoot making this file
correctly. It also means that it will continue to work even if your R
package dependencies change.

### [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act)

A very useful command line tool for testing *GitHub Actions* locally.
