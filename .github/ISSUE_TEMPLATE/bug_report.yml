        Please add **ALL** the code necessary to reproduce the bug here (step-by-step).
        By 'reproduce', we mean that someone else can copy and paste the exact same code into their R console, execute it, and get the exact same output as you.
        
        This means you need to define all variables *within* the example, including data.
        You can upload a small sample of your data by dragging-and-dropping it into this Issue. 
        Alternatively, you can include code to create some dummy data that reproduces the error. 
        If that's not possible, please at least include a screenshot of your data and other relevant details.
        
        See [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/10/how-to-make-a-reprex/) for an intro to making a reproducible example (i.e. reprex) and why they're important!
